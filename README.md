## Abstract
Scientific articles, especially review articles and literature summaries, can be great tools for finding information on a subject. Since these often feature large reference lists, these can be ways to find information on specific parts of a more general topic. This program will attempt to parse through the reference list of a provided scientific article, and sort through them based on user-provided parameters.
